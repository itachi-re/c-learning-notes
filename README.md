### 02. Pointers & Memory
- **Pointer Fundamentals** – Declaration, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic
- **Arrays** – Static and dynamic arrays with pointers
- **Memory Management** – Stack vs heap, understanding memory layout

### 03. Functions
- **Function Declaration & Definition** – Prototypes and implementations
